This code analyzes the Boston Housing dataset to predict median house prices based on various features. It performs the following steps:

1. Data Import and Cleaning:

Imports necessary libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.).
Reads the Boston Housing dataset from a CSV file.
Displays the first few rows and overall shape of the data.
Provides a summary of the data's statistical properties (mean, standard deviation.).
Removes irrelevant columns ('ZN' and 'CHAS') from the dataset.
Checks for missing values (null values).

2. Data Visualization:

Creates a correlation heatmap to visualize relationships between features.
Generates a scatter plot to explore the correlation between 'RM' (number of rooms) and 'MEDV' (median house value).
Plots a histogram to understand the distribution of median house values.

3. Data Preprocessing:

Splits the data into features (X) and target variable (Y).
Splits the data further into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

4. Model Training (Linear Regression):

Trains a linear regression model using the training data.

5. Model Prediction:

Uses the trained model to predict median house values on the testing data.

6. Model Evaluation:

Calculates the Mean Squared Error (MSE) to assess the difference between predicted and actual values.
Calculates the R-squared (RÂ²) score to measure the model's goodness of fit.

7. Feature Importance Analysis:

Analyzes the importance of each feature in the model's predictions.
Creates a DataFrame to display feature importance scores.
Visualizes feature importance using a bar chart.

8. Saving Processed Data (Optional):

Saves the processed data (features and target) to a CSV file (commented out in the code).
Running the Code:

Save the code as a Python file (e.g., boston_housing_analysis.py).
Ensure you have the required libraries installed (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn.). You can install them using pip install.
Navigate to the directory containing the file in your terminal.
Run the script using python boston_housing_analysis.py.
This code provides a basic analysis of the Boston Housing dataset using linear regression. You can further explore the data by:

Trying different machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors).
Performing feature engineering (creating new features from existing ones).
Tuning hyperparameters of the models for potentially better performance.
